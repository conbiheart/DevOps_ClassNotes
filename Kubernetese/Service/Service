Three type of Service to access application pods from outside the cluster -
Lets first discuss the service type - NODEPORT 
Below service.yaml file is for a single POD -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
 name: myapp-svc
spec:
 type: NodePort
 ports:
  - targetPort: 80
    port: 80
	nodePort: 30001
 selector:
  app: myapp
  type: webserver
--
But what else if we have multiple similar pods are running on the Instance/Node, this can be taken as a selector 
since the name of app is myapp(and it has same labels for all the similar pods) and same label set a selector for the applications as service
and when service is created it looks for a matching pods as a label and finds them either pods is single or multiple 
and the service automatically select all the pods running with same label as an endpoint and forward for the external request coming from the user.
We need not to do any additional configurations and its uses the Random algorith to distribute the loads to pods.
Second thing If the pods are distributed across multiple nodes, In this case we have web-app application on seperate nodes how the Service Nodeport acts upon ?
In this case also we need not to do any additional activity, K8 is creating a service that spans across all the nodes in the cluster automatically as well.
